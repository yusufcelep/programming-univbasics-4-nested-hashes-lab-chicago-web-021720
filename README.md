Learning# Simple Nesting Lab

## Learning Goals

- Access data from a nested hash
- Add data to and change data within a nested hash

## Introduction

Now that we've seen some examples of nested hashes, the next step is to get more
comfortable with using them. In this lab, we're going to practice accessing and
updating data within a nested hash.

## Instructions

You'll be filling out the content of a series of methods that we've defined for
you. All of the methods expect you to operate on the `programmer_hash` object,
which we've already defined and included in the body of each method. Use the
test suite to guide you. Each test is designed to tell you how to pass it.

Keep in mind that you are expected to get these tests to pass by adding or
changing information in the hash *programmatically*. In other words, if you're
asked to, for example, change the value of a certain hash key, *don't just
re-write the hash with the new value!* Use the methods we've learned and
practiced in previous lessons.

To quickly review, here is an example of adding data to a hash
programmatically:

```ruby
# good example

my_hash = {first: "I'm first!", second: "I'm second!"}
my_hash[:third] = "I'm third!"

puts my_hash
# > {first: "I'm first!", second: "I'm second!", third: "I'm third!"}
```

Changing a hash by simply re-defining it is not the goal of this lab:

```ruby
# bad example

my_hash = {first: "I'm first!", second: "I'm second!"}
my_hash = {first: "I'm first!", second: "I'm second!", third: "I'm third!"}
```

**Hint:** In some of these methods, you will need to alter `programmer_hash`,
then make sure to _return_ the entire hash, not just the altered value.

## Conclusion

Adding and updating data in a nested hash is just like adding and updating a
normal hash. If we know the structure, it is just a matter of using the right
combination of keys.

As we see examples of more complex data structures, we'll start to encounter
situations where we aren't 100% of the structure of a hash. This is one reason
why getting familiar with programmatically changing hash data is critical - we
won't always be able to _see_ the hash we're changing. Instead, we'll have to
write logic that and correctly handles accessing and updating hash data in a
more abstracted way.
